üí° See what others are building and share your projects in our [Discord](https://link.browser-use.com/discord) - we'd love to see what you create!

üå©Ô∏è Skip the setup - try our hosted version for instant browser automation! [Try it now](https://cloud.browser-use.com).

# Quick start

With pip:

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

install playwright:

```bash
playwright install
```

Spin up your agent:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from browser_use import Agent
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Go to Reddit, search for 'browser-use', click on the first post and return the first comment.",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
    )
    result = await agent.run()
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Add your API keys for the provider you want to use to your `.env` file.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

For other settings, models, and more, check out the [documentation üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com).
